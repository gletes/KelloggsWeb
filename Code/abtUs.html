            <h1>Discover Our Best Days</h1>
            <p>1898 - In a fortunately failed attempt  at making a cereal of wheat, oats and cornmeal clusters, our company’s  founder, W.K. Kellogg, and his brother, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, changed  breakfast forever when they accidentally flaked wheat berries. W.K.  kept experimenting until he flaked corn, and created the delicious  recipe for Kellogg’s® Corn Flakes.

            1906 - W.K. Kellogg opened the “Battle  Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company” and carefully hired his first 44  employees. Together they created the initial batch of Kellogg’s® Corn  Flakes and brought to life W.K.’s vision for a great-tasting,  better-for-you breakfast.
            
            1914 - Kellogg’s® Corn Flakes were  introduced to a new country: Canada (Later the Kellogg Company would  spread the goodness of grains around the world by opening factories in  South Africa, Australia, England, Mexico, Japan, India and more). Today  Kellogg’s® brightens breakfast in over 180 countries around the world.
            
            1923 - The Kellogg Company made a bold  move and became the first in the food industry to hire a dietitian.  Mary Barber started the Kellogg’s® Home Economics Department and began  defining the roles different foods played in proper diets.
            
            1923 - Kellogg imports cereals into South Africa.
            
            1928 - Rice Krispies® are invented.
            
            1930 - The W.K. Kellogg Foundation was founded, with the mission to help children realise their full potential.
            
            1948 - A manufacturing plant is opened in Springs, South Africa.
            
            1969 - The Kellogg Company was honored  to provide breakfast for the legendary Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and  Michael Collins during their groundbreaking Apollo 11 trip to the moon.
            
            1997 - We opened the W.K. Kellogg  Institute for Food and Nutrition Research — where food scientists,  nutritionists and engineers transform wholesome grains and other  ingredients into great-tasting and good-for-your-family foods.
            
            2006 - The Kellogg Company celebrated our 100-year commitment to nutrition, health and quality.
            
            2014 - We took a big step towards  helping our community by launching Breakfast for Better Days – a  breakfast feeding scheme that allows us to serve breakfast cereals to  schools across South Africa. Breakfast is the most important meal of a  child’s life because of the impact it has in unlocking their potential.  We are currently giving a nutritious breakfast to approximately 47 600  children in schools and early childhood development cerntres around  South Africa.
            
            2015 - The joint venture with Tolaram  Nigeria Limited for just under USD 1Billion was formed.  This made it  Kellogg’s biggest investment to date outside of the United States of  America (followed by a MassFood acquisition in Egypt).
            2018 - Kellogg launched the Noodles  range in South Africa, a first for Kellogg’s globally, a unique offering  in the company’s drive to produce culturally relevant foods that fit  into its consumers’ lifestyles and needs. This was followed by a noodles  launch in Egypt
            
            2020 - the noodles production facility  in The Kingdom of Eswatini is opened giving the company even better  market access to accelerate noodles market penetration into the African  continent because The Kingdom of Eswatini, is a member of SACU, SADC and  COMESA trading zones.
            
            Today - We’re proudly upholding the  values W.K. Kellogg instilled more than 100 years ago — but now we’re  doing it in 180 countries across the world. We still provide you and  your family with breakfasts that lead to better days, and we flake corn  the same way W.K. Kellogg did back in 1898.</p>
